"Your protein intake is solid at 145g (good for muscle building!), but your carbs are quite low at 120g. Consider adding a serving of rice or sweet potato post-workout to fuel recovery and performance."

"Great variety in your meals today! To hit your calorie goal, try adding a handful of nuts as an afternoon snack - about 200 calories and healthy fats that'll keep you satisfied."

"I notice you're often low on fiber. Easy fix: swap white rice for brown rice, add berries to breakfast, and include veggies at lunch. Aim for 25-30g daily."
